# Induskriti
## A flask web app

Using only *flask* and its templating engine *jinja2*,  Induskriti web app uses minimal functionality
where it accepts name and email from the users and sends them email containing coupon discount to be
used while buying products. I have used **sqlite3** database and *flask-sqlalchemy* as ORM to create models
while *flask-migrate* is used to migrate any changes made to the models as well as to the tables.
